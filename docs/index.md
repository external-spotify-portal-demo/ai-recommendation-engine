# Migrating to the New AI Recommendation Engine

Welcome to the migration guide for moving from the legacy Spotify Recommendation Engine to the new AI Recommendation Engine. This guide will walk you through the required changes and provide best practices to ensure a smooth transition.

---

## Overview

Spotify's new AI Recommendation Engine offers:
- Deep learning-based user behavior modeling
- Improved personalization and diversity
- Lower latency and better scalability

This migration focuses on updating the integration logic, dependencies, and response handling in your project.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or above
- Access to the Spotify Developer Portal
- Credentials for both engines (legacy and new AI)
- Existing implementation using the legacy engine

---

## Step 1: Backup Your Current Implementation

Before proceeding, back up your current codebase and configuration files:

```bash
cp package.json package.json.bak
cp -r src/ src_legacy_backup/
```

---

## Step 2: Update `package.json`

Remove the old engine dependency:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "music-player-recommendation-engine": "^3.2.1"
}
```

Replace it with the new AI engine package:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "spotify-ai-recommendation": "^1.0.0"
}
```

Then install the new package:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 3: Update Import Statements

Replace legacy imports like:

```javascript
const legacyReco = require('music-player-recommendation-engine');
```

With the new AI engine:

```javascript
const aiReco = require('spotify-ai-recommendation');
```

---

## Step 4: Adapt Recommendation Logic

### Legacy Example
```javascript
legacyReco.getRecommendations(userId, (err, recs) => {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log(recs);
});
```

### New AI Example
```javascript
aiReco.fetchAIRecommendations({ userId }).then(recs => {
  console.log(recs);
}).catch(console.error);
```

---

## Step 5: Test the Integration

Use mock user IDs to validate results:

```bash
npm run test:recommendations
```

Make sure you:
- Receive a valid list of track IDs
- Experience consistent response times

---

## Step 6: Deploy

Once testing is complete:

```bash
git commit -am "Migrate to new AI recommendation engine"
git push origin main
depploy
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Module not found` | Ensure the new package was installed properly |
| `Empty response` | Confirm the user ID exists in the AI model |
| `Latency spikes` | Use caching where applicable |
